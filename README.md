# CEN-441-Artificiaial-Intelligence-
After completing the semester course CEN-441 (Artificial Intelligence) the task was assigned to all the class to make a gaming-based project i: e., complex engineering problem (CEP) after exploring the internet and many games like Chrome dinosaur automation with gestures, snake game and many games using PyGame which are artificial Intelligence based I love the concept of “ROCK PAPER SCISCOR” with computer vision  techniques, reason to choose this games is that this game is according to the concepts and requirements given by our teacher for CEP.
For this CEP I had used a NASNET Mobile model to recognize my hand signs i: e., rock paper and scissor which the final accuracy of 0.9880% which is quite good on the other hand my system will predict the any sign. As applying AI to the gaming field is emerging field, I loved a lot while automating this game.
The Demo videos are also available in the given YouTube links:
